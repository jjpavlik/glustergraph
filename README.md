# glustergraph

Show your gluster volumes and bricks in a graphicalish way. This was tested on GlusterFS 3.4 and Java 7, back in 2014 so it may require some changes for newer GlusterFS versions. I'm not working with gluster anymore, that's why I have't tested this ever again.

# Blogpost

Unfortunately at the time I decided to write glustergraph my blog was entirely in Spanish, the particular entries were:

if you have any questions, you can just add a comment in english to the post and I'll be more than glad to answer.
